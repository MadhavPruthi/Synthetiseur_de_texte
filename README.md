So to overcome this we came up with Synthetiseur_de_texte.Technology can never take place of the teacher but stil we tried to bridge the gap as much as possible.</i>

* **Recorded lectures** can be provided which are then converted into summary for quick **revision**.

* **Questions** are also generated from the summary to help better understand the lecture.

* If the recorded lecture is not available **youtube link** to the video can be provided.
